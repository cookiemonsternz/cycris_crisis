Upon boring a hole through the layer of metal, they discovered a large array of cables connecting a large metal box to a massive array of smaller boxes.

It swung around the moon at a rate of around 1,200 km/ph at its end, causing a slight wobble in its orbit. Inside of the tower, was what appeared to be a control station, obviously not meant for organics. What it is used for, we may not ever know."

We believe that these metal boxes store the central processors of cybrex pops. Unfortunately, we have been unable to open the boxes via any means, so the secrets of the cybrex still remain a mystery too us. We were however, able to access the control centre, giving us valuable data about the ship. From this data, we have learnt that this ship departed from cybrex alpha when the cybrex retreated, along with two other ships, to create alternative backup systems in case cybrex alpha was destroyed. This ship was planned to become Cybrex Delta, but its goal was evidently not fulfilled."
